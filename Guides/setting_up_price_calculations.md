### Setting up price calculation

Lychee slicer can calculate the expected cost of what you are printing if you input the price you pay for your resin.

1. Got to `File -> Prefereces`
1. Select `Printers and Resins`
1. Click the cog beside your resin profile.
1. Select the currency and size of the bottles you buy.
1. Enter the price.

When you have done this the next time you slice a file you will get a price estimation along with the other information that shows up in the modal.

You can also click the 'Estimate resin use' link in the lower left of the main panel to have it calculate the resin expected for the print and the cost that resin works out at.
