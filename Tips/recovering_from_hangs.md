### Recovering from hangs

Sometimes the application can hang during a processing event such as adding/optimizing supports or after completing a slice operation. You can sometimes recover from this hang by saving, closing and reopening the application then reloading your scene file.

1. Use the save shortcode. Press `Crtl` + `s`
1. Exit or force close the application.
1. Reopen the application and load the saved scene.
